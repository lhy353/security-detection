# Canonry

Agent-first open-source AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) operating platform. Track how AI answer engines **mention** your brand in answers and **cite** your domain in sources across Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, then act on the signal through the content engine and integrations.

**Website:** [canonry.ai](https://canonry.ai) | **Org:** [ainyc.ai](https://ainyc.ai) | **Docs:** [github.com/AINYC/canonry](https://github.com/AINYC/canonry)

**CLI:** invoke as `cnry` (short form) or `canonry` — both ship with the npm package and are interchangeable. Examples in this skill use `cnry`.

## When to Use

- Tracking brand **mentions** in AI answer text and **citations** in source links across providers
- Expanding the tracked-query basket from an ICP description (`cnry discover run`)
- Running technical SEO audits (14‑factor scoring)
- Implementing structured data (JSON‑LD)
- Diagnosing indexing gaps via Google Search Console / Bing Webmaster Tools
- Wiring server-side traffic (Cloud Run, WordPress, Vercel) and GA4 referrals into a single AEO signal
- Optimizing `llms.txt`, sitemaps, robots.txt for AI crawlers
- Submitting URLs to Google Indexing API and Bing IndexNow
- Analyzing competitor citation patterns

## Core Philosophy

- **Measure outcomes** — AI models are black boxes; track mentions + citations, don't assume causality
- **Signal over noise** — Focus on high‑intent queries; avoid granular targeting until base visibility exists
- **CLI‑native** — API‑driven changes over manual CMS clicks; faster, repeatable, auditable

## What Canonry Measures (Vocabulary)

Two parallel signals are tracked per (query × provider) snapshot. They are independent — a model can do either, both, or neither — never conflate them.

| Term | Means | Headline metric |
|---|---|---|
| **mentioned** | The project's brand or domain appears in the LLM's **answer text** (the prose the model returns). | **Mention Coverage** — share of (query × provider) snapshots where the brand was mentioned. **Mention Share** is the project's share among the cited+mentioned set vs competitors. |
| **cited** | The project's domain appears in the LLM's **source links** (the grounding citations returned alongside the answer). | **Citation Coverage** — share of snapshots where the domain was in the source list. |

Configure `spec.brandAliases` on the project (or pass via `cnry apply`) so the mention detector catches "Meta" alongside "Facebook", etc. The downloadable report (`cnry report`) and the dashboard both lead with Mention Coverage; Citation Coverage rides as the secondary gauge.

## How to Operate

A canonry engagement follows the same loop regardless of project size:

1. **Diagnose** — Run a baseline sweep (`cnry run <project> --wait`) and a technical audit (`cnry technical-aeo run <project> --wait`, then `cnry technical-aeo score <project> --format json`). The audit crawls every page in the project's sitemap (auto-discovered from `/sitemap.xml`, the sitemap index, or `robots.txt`) so readiness reflects the whole site, not just one page, and persists the score to the dashboard. Read Mention Coverage first, Citation Coverage second. See `references/aeo-analysis.md`.
2. **Prioritize** — Triage by impact: indexing gaps → schema gaps → content gaps → query strategy. Branded-term losses are urgent.
3. **Execute** — Apply fixes via the canonry CLI or platform integrations. Use `--dry-run` on supported mutations (`cnry project delete`, `cnry query replace`, `cnry backfill ...`) to preview before committing. See `references/canonry-cli.md` for the full command catalog and `references/wordpress-integration.md` for the WordPress workflow.
4. **Monitor** — Re-run sweeps weekly (`cnry run --all --wait` fans out across every project). Correlate visibility shifts with deployments and competitor moves.
5. **Report** — Lead with data, not interpretation: "Lost the mention for `<query>` on Gemini between <date> and <date> — two competitors moved in. Here's what to fix." For a one-command client-facing summary, run `cnry report <project>` to generate a self-contained HTML bundle (mention + citation hero, competitor landscape, GSC + GA4 performance, insights, suggested next queries). Same payload is available via `--format json` and the `canonry_report` MCP tool.

**Verifying without polluting metrics**: when you need to test something on your own initiative — "did the latest provider deploy work?", "is this regression reproducible?", "would this query actually surface us?" — use `cnry run <project> --probe --provider <p> --query "..."`. Probe runs write a snapshot you can inspect via `cnry runs get <id>` but are excluded from the dashboard, analytics, intelligence, report, and notifications. Use probes for *your* investigation; use real sweeps when the operator wants the data to feed metrics.

## Surgical Reads

When you need a specific value rather than a full payload, use the dot-path getter:

```bash
cnry get <project> scores.mentionShare.value
cnry get <project> scores.mentionCoverage.value
cnry get <project> insights[0].severity
cnry get <project> --from report scores.citationCoverage.value
```

`cnry get` resolves a path into the project's overview (default) or any registered source (`report`, `traffic`, `discovery`, etc.). Returns scalar values without forcing the agent to grep through a 30 KB JSON dump.

## Common Starting Points

- **New site, 0 citations** → submit to GSC/Bing first; basic LocalBusiness/Service schema; `llms.txt`; trim to 8–12 high-intent queries. See `references/indexing.md`.
- **Established site, regression** → diff canonry runs to find the loss window; verify schema is intact; resubmit affected URLs. See `references/aeo-analysis.md`.
- **Empty / generic query basket** → describe the ICP and let discovery expand: `cnry discover run <project> --icp "..." --wait`, then `cnry discover promote <session-id>` to adopt the cited + aspirational queries. Multi-location projects can geo-constrain with `--locations <label,...>`.
- **Multi-county targeting** → reference counties in `areaServed` schema and `llms.txt`; do not split into per-county queries until base visibility exists.

## Google Analytics 4

GA4 is a first-class signal alongside citation tracking. Connect once with `cnry ga connect <project> --property-id <id> --key-file <path>`; `cnry ga sync` then pulls daily landing-page traffic, AI-referral sessions across 10 known providers (chatgpt, perplexity, claude, gemini, openai, anthropic, copilot, phind, you.com, meta.ai), and social referrals split into Organic vs Paid via GA4's `channelGroup` — and persists everything into four DB tables (`gaTrafficSnapshots`, `gaAiReferrals`, `gaSocialReferrals`, `gaTrafficSummaries`). All read commands query that local store, so they are fast and quotaless once a sync has run. AI referrals are tracked across three GA4 attribution dimensions (session source / first-user source / manual UTM) and joined to landing pages, so you can see which page each AI provider sent traffic to. Use `cnry ga traffic` for the current snapshot, `cnry ga attribution --trend` for a unified channel-share overview with biggest-mover deltas, and `cnry ga ai-referral-history` / `cnry ga social-referral-history` for daily series. See `references/canonry-cli.md` for the full command catalog and return-shape details.

## Server-Side Traffic

When the project ships behind a server you control, wire crawler + AI-referral evidence directly from the edge: `cnry traffic connect cloud-run | wordpress | vercel <project> ...` writes credentials to `~/.canonry/config.yaml`, `cnry traffic sync` pulls and classifies logs into hourly buckets, and `cnry traffic events / sources / status` expose the rollups. See `references/server-side-traffic.md` for adapter-specific setup.

**Vercel gotcha:** a freshly connected Vercel source captures only going-forward traffic — `lastSyncedAt` is seeded to NOW to avoid the 30-day default window exceeding Vercel's ~14-day request-logs retention (which would otherwise throw on every first sync). Use `cnry traffic backfill <project> --source <id> --days N` for historical recovery. If an idle Vercel/Cloud Run source has been failing long enough that `lastSyncedAt` aged past retention, unstick it with `cnry traffic reset <project> --source <id> --advance-to-now`.

## Local AEO (Google Business Profile)

For businesses with a physical location or service area, Google Business Profile is the local-AEO signal source — reviews, search-keyword impressions, daily performance metrics, and (for hotels) structured amenities + booking CTAs all feed how AI engines answer local-intent queries. Connect with `cnry gbp connect <project>`, discover locations with `cnry gbp locations discover <project>`, and pick which sync with `cnry gbp locations select/deselect`.

**Hard prerequisites and gotchas — read `references/google-business-profile.md` before attempting setup:** GBP requires a Google access-form approval (0 QPM until granted), the only OAuth scope is the write-capable `business.manage`, **reviews live on a separately-gated legacy v4 API that the Basic approval does NOT grant** (and can't be self-enabled), and the **Q&A API was retired (2025-11-03)**. Keyword data is heavily privacy-redacted (often 100% for small businesses); an empty place-action profile is a real AEO finding to surface, but an empty lodging result is a verify-not-a-gap (the Lodging API can return 0 readable groups even when the owner-facing "Hotel details" panel has amenities set). The reference doc has the full setup walkthrough, the real-world data shapes, and the troubleshooting matrix.

## Built-in Analyst (Aero)

Canonry ships a built-in agent — Aero — for users who don't already have one. Drive it from the CLI:

```bash
cnry agent ask <project> "what changed since the last sweep?"
cnry agent ask <project> "..." --provider claude --scope read-only
cnry agent memory list <project>          # durable project notes
```

Aero also wakes unprompted after every `run.completed` so insights and regressions get analyzed without a user click. Users who already run their own agent (Claude Code, Codex, custom) wire webhooks instead: `cnry agent attach <project> --url <webhook-url>` subscribes to `run.completed`, `insight.critical`, `insight.high`, `citation.gained`.

## Boundaries & Safety

- **Never touch live WordPress without explicit approval**
- **Back up `~/.canonry/config.yaml` before any config edit**
- **Never fabricate mention or citation data** — if a sweep hasn't run, say so; never coerce `answerMentioned` null → false (null = "not checked")
- **Client data stays private** — canonry repo is public; no real domains in issues
- **Respect API rate limits** — batch operations, avoid tight loops
