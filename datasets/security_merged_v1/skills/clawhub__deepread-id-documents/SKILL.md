# DeepRead ID Documents

Read passports, driver's licenses, and national ID cards — scans or phone photos — into clean, typed JSON for KYC and customer onboarding: name, document number, dates of birth/issue/expiry, and nationality. Every field carries a `needs_review` flag, because in identity verification, a confident-but-wrong character matters.

> **Use responsibly.** Only process identity documents you are authorized to handle, for legitimate KYC/onboarding/verification purposes, with the document holder's knowledge and applicable consent. This skill POSTs the document to `https://api.deepread.tech` and polls for results. No system files are modified. Review DeepRead's [privacy policy](https://www.deepread.tech/privacy) for data handling.

  }
}
```

## Extract + Expiry Check (Python)

```python
import datetime
fields = {f["key"]: f["value"] for f in result["extraction"]["fields"]}

# Flag expired or soon-to-expire IDs
exp = fields.get("expiry_date")
if exp:
    days = (datetime.date.fromisoformat(exp) - datetime.date.today()).days
    if days < 0:   print("⚠ EXPIRED document — reject")
    elif days < 90: print(f"⚠ expires in {days} days")

# Route low-confidence fields (glare, worn print) to manual review
for f in result["extraction"]["fields"]:
    if f.get("needs_review"):
        print(f"REVIEW {f['key']}: {f.get('review_reason')}")
```

## Use Cases

- **KYC / customer onboarding** — auto-fill identity fields from an uploaded ID
- **Age / expiry verification** — confirm DOB and that the document is valid
- **Account recovery / fraud ops** — structured ID data for verification workflows
- **Travel / hospitality check-in** — capture passport details quickly

## Store Compliantly — Redact the Image

After extracting the fields you need, redact the raw ID image before archiving or sharing, so you're not storing full identity documents in the clear:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.deepread.tech/v1/pii/redact -H "X-API-Key: $DEEPREAD_API_KEY" -F "file=@id.jpg"
```

Install: `clawhub install uday390/deepread-pii`

## Tips

- **Photos work** — vision AI handles phone captures, but flat, glare-free, well-lit images extract best.
- **Expect `needs_review`** on worn cards/glare — that's the feature; verify those manually.
- **Don't store more than you need** — extract the minimum fields and redact the source.
