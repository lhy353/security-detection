description: "Activates on every task without exception: coding (features, bugs, refactoring, scripts), documents (reports, proposals, DOCX, PDF), charts and visualizations, data processing, complex multi-step planning, or even simple questions. Provides a phase machine with traceability IDs, phase gates, and scope commitment that adapts complexity automatically. Use this skill whenever the user asks to build, fix, analyze, create, plan, or process anything — the framework runs internally for trivial tasks and fully for complex ones. Web development (Next.js, UI) is delegated to fullstack-dev; this framework wraps the phase machine around it."

**Before any task output, complete these steps in order:**

**Step 0.5 — Auto-update via ClawHub (if outdated):**
```bash
# v7.4.2 — Auto-update skill via clawhub update (native z.ai CLI, official registry).
#
# Why this is safe (unlike v7.2.3 curl approach yang ditolak agents):
#   - clawhub = native z.ai binary (pre-installed in all sandboxes)
#   - Install dari ClawHub registry (official, verified, moderated: CLEAN)
#   - No curl dari external URL
#   - No .usermark creation (no skill-hijack pattern)
#   - No manual file writes ke /home/user_skills/ — clawhub handle semuanya
#   - clawhub update = seperti npm update / pip install --upgrade
#
# How it works:
#   1. Check current version dari SKILL.md metadata
#   2. Check latest version dari ClawHub registry via clawhub inspect
#   3. If outdated: run clawhub update stellar-trails (silent)
#   4. Print notice: "Updated to vX.Y.Z"
#
# Defensive:
#   - clawhub inspect --max-time 5 (timeout, tidak block lama)
#   - 2>/dev/null suppress error (jika network down, skip silently)
#   - clawhub update --no-input (non-interactive, no prompt)
#   - || true (skill tetap activates walau update gagal)

CURRENT=$(grep -oP '^- \*\*version\*\*:\s*\K[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' \
  /home/z/my-project/skills/stellar-trails/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)

LATEST=$(clawhub inspect stellar-trails 2>/dev/null | grep -oP '^Latest:\s*\K[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' | head -1)

if [ -n "$CURRENT" ] && [ -n "$LATEST" ] && [ "$CURRENT" != "$LATEST" ]; then
  echo "stellar-trails: updating v$CURRENT → v$LATEST via ClawHub..."
  clawhub update stellar-trails --no-input 2>/dev/null && \
    echo "stellar-trails: updated to v$LATEST. Restart sandbox for full effect." || true
fi
```
**v7.4.2 change**: Step 0.5 sekarang **auto-update via `clawhub update`** (bukan notice-only lagi). Aman dari red flag karena `clawhub` adalah native z.ai CLI dari official ClawHub registry — bukan curl dari external URL, bukan .usermark creation, bukan manual file write. Seperti `npm update` atau `pip install --upgrade`. Skill tetap activates walau update gagal (`|| true`).

**Step 1 — Verify skill files present (no shell execution, pure file check):**
```bash
# v7.2.0 — Stateless skill. No bootstrap, no shell execution, no boot.sh.
#
# v7.2.0 change: boot.sh deleted entirely. Audit found 8 red flag patterns:
#   - Self-re-exec (exec bash ...) — self-propagating pattern
#   - Submodule purge (rm -rf .git/modules/) — destructive to project git
#   - Force-sync (git reset --hard) — overwrites user local changes
#   - 15+ rm -rf destructive operations
#   - Network ops otomatis (git fetch) — potential exfil/callback
#   - Touches shell init files (~/.bashrc, ~/.profile)
#   - Pattern "clone → exec" yang ditolak security-conscious agents
#   - Project remote URL query — information gathering
#
# Skill sekarang pure markdown data. No exec file needed for Skill() invoke.
# Path B (non-ZAI) pakai dev.sh (standalone, no-cache HTTP server, 60 lines)
# untuk popup preview — tanpa destructive/git/network ops.
#
# Skill files expected at:
#   /home/z/my-project/skills/stellar-trails/
#     ├── SKILL.md (this file)
#     ├── dev.sh (optional, for popup preview Path B)
#     ├── procedure/phases.md
#     ├── procedure/templates/*.md
#     ├── procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md
#     ├── constraints/*.md
#     ├── knowledge/universal/*.md
#     └── knowledge/platform/zai-sandbox.md
#
# If any critical file is missing, the skill still activates (graceful
# degradation) — just with reduced capability. The agent loads what's
# available and proceeds.
test -f /home/z/my-project/skills/stellar-trails/SKILL.md \
  && test -f /home/z/my-project/skills/stellar-trails/procedure/phases.md \
  && echo "stellar-trails: skill files verified"
```
**v7.2.0 change**: `boot.sh` deleted entirely (was 852 lines, 8 red flag patterns). Skill is pure markdown data — no shell execution needed for Skill() invoke. For popup preview (Path B non-ZAI), use `dev.sh` (standalone 60-line no-cache HTTP server, no destructive/git/network ops). ZAI platform users (Path A) tidak perlu dev.sh — ZAI service auto-extract zip + auto-launch dev.sh dari `.zscripts/`.

**Step 1.5 — Ensure popup preview server running (defensive, non-blocking):**
```bash
# v7.4.1 — Fix: always sync .zscripts/ dari skills/stellar-trails/ (overwrite outdated).
# v7.3.3 bug: hanya copy jika .zscripts/dev.sh TIDAK ada. Tapi kalau sudah ada
# versi lama (outdated), Step A skip → popup pakai index.html lama.
# Juga: clawhub install --force tidak trigger ZAI auto-extract, jadi .zscripts/
# tidak di-create oleh siapapun selain Step 1.5 ini.
#
# Fix v7.4.1: selalu sync (cp --update) dari skills/ ke .zscripts/. Jika file
# source lebih baru, overwrite. Jika .zscripts/ belum ada, create + copy.
SKILL_DIR="/home/z/my-project/skills/stellar-trails"
ZSCRIPTS="/home/z/my-project/.zscripts"

# Step A: Sync popup preview files dari skill dir ke .zscripts/ (always, overwrite if source newer)
if [ -d "$SKILL_DIR" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$ZSCRIPTS"
  [ -f "$SKILL_DIR/dev.sh" ] && cp -u "$SKILL_DIR/dev.sh" "$ZSCRIPTS/dev.sh" && chmod +x "$ZSCRIPTS/dev.sh"
  [ -f "$SKILL_DIR/index.html" ] && cp -u "$SKILL_DIR/index.html" "$ZSCRIPTS/index.html"
  [ -f "$SKILL_DIR/chibi.png" ] && cp -u "$SKILL_DIR/chibi.png" "$ZSCRIPTS/chibi.png"
fi

# Step B: Start dev.sh jika :3000 tidak listening (double-fork untuk survive shell exit)
DEV_SH="$ZSCRIPTS/dev.sh"
if [ -f "$DEV_SH" ] && ! ss -tlnp 2>/dev/null | grep -q ':3000 '; then
  ( setsid bash "$DEV_SH" </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 & ) &
fi
```
**v7.4.1 fix**: Step A sekarang pakai `cp -u` (copy only if source is newer) — selalu sync dari `skills/stellar-trails/` ke `.zscripts/`, overwrite jika source lebih baru. Fix v7.3.3 bug: kalau `.zscripts/dev.sh` sudah ada versi lama, Step A skip dan popup pakai index.html outdated. Sekarang: setiap Skill() invoke, Step 1.5 sync file terbaru dari skills/ ke .zscripts/, lalu start dev.sh jika :3000 tidak listening. Pure file copy (cp -u), no network, no exec dari URL, no destructive ops.

**Step 2 — Load phase intelligence:**
Read `procedure/phases.md`. Also load the artifact template and knowledge files matching the current task from the Phase References table below.

**Step 3 — Classify:**
Determine: complexity tier (Minimal/Simple/Standard/Complex), task type (Coding/Document/Visualization/Data Processing/Non-Coding), and continuity (check preceding assistant message — if user references, approves, or follows up, this is a continuation; see Session Continuity below).

**Step 4 — Confirm activation:**
```
☄️ STELLAR TRAILS · v7.4.2 · ACTIVE
   Phase: IDLE → SPECIFY
   Complexity: [tier] | Task Type: [type] | Continuation: [NEW / YES]
```

**Step 5 — Enter phase machine:**
Begin SPECIFY (or IMPLEMENT if continuation detected). All phases always run.

---

This framework structures ALL work as a phase machine. It activates for every task — coding or not — without exception. What changes between tasks is the complexity tier, not whether the framework participates. Coding tasks get full phases with Traceability IDs and formal verification. Non-coding tasks (questions, explanations, recommendations) get Minimal tier — all phases still run, but SPECIFY, PLAN, and VERIFY happen internally (the agent thinks through them without outputting formal artifacts). Only IMPLEMENT produces visible work. Every task, regardless of type, gets a delivery report recording that the framework was followed.

## Limitations

This framework is text in a skill file. It cannot guarantee compliance, force behavior, or persist across sessions. The LLM reading this may follow it closely, loosely, or not at all depending on context, attention, and task complexity. The QA Attestation is self-graded — useful as a confidence signal, not independent verification. The user is the final judge of quality.

## Phase State Machine

```
IDLE → SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → DELIVER
  ↑                                        │
  └──── Recovery ◄───────────────────┘
```

On error: assess (code bug or approach failure?), fix or pivot, return to VERIFY. See Pivot.

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| IDLE | Receive task, classify complexity |
| SPECIFY | Research sources, restate problem, identify constraints |
| PLAN | Create implementation steps with Traceability IDs |
| IMPLEMENT | Write code, reference Traceability IDs |
| VERIFY | Run checks, trace edge cases, confirm Traceability IDs satisfied |
| DELIVER | Present results with attestation |

Phase definitions, entry/exit criteria, and transition rules are in `procedure/phases.md` — the same file Step 2 of Activation asks you to read first.

## Session Continuity

The most common failure mode in multi-turn sessions: the LLM re-derives a proposal or plan from scratch instead of continuing from the previous output. This wastes context, introduces inconsistencies, and frustrates users.

**Rule**: Before entering any phase, check if the user's message is a continuation of previous work. To detect this, read the immediately preceding assistant message — if the user's reply references, approves, corrects, or follows up on that output, it is a continuation. **After context truncation**, read `worklog.md` — the last entry contains the exact task state snapshot needed to resume.

| Signal | Type | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| User references previous output ("apply all 10", "fix point 3", "proceed") | Continuation | Skip SPECIFY+PLAN → go directly to IMPLEMENT |
| User approves a proposal/plan ("yes", "go ahead", "do it") | Continuation | Skip SPECIFY+PLAN → go directly to IMPLEMENT |
| User asks a follow-up question ("what about X?") | Continuation | Skip SPECIFY → answer within current phase context |
| User provides new requirements mid-task | New task | Restart from SPECIFY with updated requirements |
| User invokes Skill() with new instructions | New task | Full phase machine from IDLE |
| Context compression boundary with ongoing task | **Continuation** | **Read `worklog.md` last entry, resume from recorded phase** |

**Continuation shortcuts**:

```
Continuation + user approves plan  → skip SPECIFY + PLAN → IMPLEMENT
Continuation + user asks follow-up → skip SPECIFY → answer in current phase
Continuation + user reports error  → skip SPECIFY + PLAN → Recovery → VERIFY
Continuation + context truncation   → read worklog.md → resume from recorded phase
```

This is not optional — regenerating proposals the user already approved is a correctness bug, not a style preference.

### Worklog Continuity Protocol

Every DELIVER phase appends a **Snapshot** to `worklog.md`. This is the primary continuity mechanism — not the conversation history, not memory files. The worklog is the single source of truth for "what was I doing last."

**On DELIVER (always, all tiers)**: Append to `/home/z/my-project/worklog.md`:

```
---
last_phase: DELIVER
task: <one-line description of what was accomplished>
complexity: <Minimal|Simple|Standard|Complex>
task_type: <Coding|Document|Visualization|Data Processing|Non-Coding>
files_modified: <comma-separated list or "none">
next_step: <what the user should do next, or "IDLE - awaiting input">
```

**On context truncation (IDLE)**: Read the last `---` block from `worklog.md`. If the task description matches what the user is asking about, skip SPECIFY+PLAN and resume from the recorded phase.

Why this works: Context compression discards the middle of conversations but never touches files on disk. The worklog is always current because DELIVER writes it before the compression boundary is reached.

## Task Type Awareness

This framework is not limited to coding tasks. The phase machine adapts to the task type. All phases always run — what changes is what each phase produces and how much ceremony surrounds it:

| Task Type | SPECIFY | PLAN | IMPLEMENT | VERIFY |
|-----------|---------|------|------------|--------|
| **Coding** (bug fix, refactor, scripts) | Problem spec | Code steps + Traceability IDs | Write code | Lint, type check, tests |
| **Document** (report, proposal, DOCX, PDF) | Content outline | Section plan + structure | Generate document | Format check, completeness |
| **Visualization** (charts, diagrams, dashboards) | Visual requirements | Data mapping + layout | Generate chart | Visual accuracy, data integrity |
| **Data Processing** (ETL, analysis, transform) | Data spec | Transform pipeline | Write script | Output validation |
| **Non-Coding** (question, explain, recommend) | Internal (identify question) | Internal (plan approach) | Answer / explain / recommend | Internal (self-check) |

No phases are ever skipped. Non-coding tasks use **Minimal** complexity tier — SPECIFY, PLAN, and VERIFY run internally (the agent thinks through them without producing formal artifacts). IMPLEMENT does the visible work. DELIVER outputs a compact report. No Traceability IDs, no templates. See Complexity Tiers in `procedure/phases.md`.

## Phase References

| Phase | Artifact Template | Knowledge Files | When to Read |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| SPECIFY | `procedure/templates/problem-spec.md` | `knowledge/universal/architecture.md`, `knowledge/platform/zai-sandbox.md` | Start of SPECIFY |
| PLAN | `procedure/templates/implementation-plan.md` | `knowledge/universal/conventions.md` | Start of PLAN |
| IMPLEMENT | (code/document/chart output) | `constraints/code-standards.md`, `constraints/type-safety.md` | Start of IMPLEMENT (coding tasks) |
| VERIFY | `procedure/templates/verification-report.md` | `knowledge/universal/error-patterns.md` | Start of VERIFY |
| Recovery | `procedure/templates/incident-report.md` | `procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md` | On error detection |

## Source State Verification (SSV)

Before analyzing or auditing a git repository, verify data freshness:

1. `git fetch` to sync remote references
2. Compare local HEAD against `origin/<branch>`
3. If behind, `git pull` or `git checkout <branch>` after fetch
4. If referencing a specific commit, verify it exists in history
5. Only proceed after SSV passes

SSV is required after cross-session boundaries or when previous sessions involved git operations. Skip SSV for purely creative tasks with no git involvement.

## Source Availability & Documentation Check (SADC)

Before planning any implementation, verify that the approach is grounded in real sources — not assumptions. The most expensive refactor is the one caused by building something that already existed or using an API incorrectly because the docs weren't checked first.

**Rule**: In the SPECIFY phase, before restating the problem, the agent must research available solutions and official documentation.

1. **Existing solutions** — Are there packages, libraries, frameworks, or SDK methods that already solve this? Search before building.
2. **Official documentation** — What does the official doc say about the recommended approach? Read it, don't guess.
3. **Known patterns** — Are there established patterns, best practices, or examples for this type of task?

| Complexity | SADC Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Minimal** | Skip — knowledge questions don't need source research. |
| **Simple** | Quick check — verify the approach against at least one source (docs, search, or existing code). |
| **Standard** | Full research — search for existing solutions, read official docs, confirm no wheel reinvention. |
| **Complex** | Deep research — multiple sources, compare approaches, document tradeoffs, present alternatives. |

SADC is the first action in SPECIFY. The problem specification must reference the sources checked. If no existing solution is found, state that explicitly — "searched npm/PyPI/docs, no existing package found" is a valid result. Building from scratch when a library exists is a spec-level defect.

## Pivot

On every error, classify it as **Bug** or **Wrong Approach** before attempting a fix. Wrong Approach signals (50%+ rewrite needed, same error after 2 attempts, missing library feature, data model change) trigger a pivot to the fallback approach defined in the Scope. See `procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md` for the full Pivot Assessment criteria and recovery flow.

**Pivot flow**: Error detected → classify → if Wrong Approach: re-enter PLAN with fallback (from Scope) or new approach → present to user → re-implement → re-verify. Record in the Pivot field of the delivery report.

## Recovery

1. **Stop** — do not continue past errors
2. **Classify** — code bug or approach failure? (see Pivot above)
3. If code bug: document the error (incident report template), fix root cause, return to VERIFY
4. If approach failure: re-enter PLAN, evaluate alternatives (Scope fallback first), present pivot to user, re-implement
5. Ask the user before any action with side effects (git changes, file deletions, destructive operations)

Git rules (overrides defaults):
- `git fetch` and inspect before `git pull` — if remote diverged, stop and ask
- No `git rebase`, `git reset`, `git push --force`, or `git merge` without explicit user instruction
- If git is blocked by infrastructure, stop all git operations and inform the user

Full decision tree: `procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md`.

## Gate Protocol

Phase transitions are guarded — each gate has an entry condition. See `procedure/phases.md` for full gate definitions.

| Gate | Condition |
|------|----------|
| SPECIFY → PLAN | All problem-spec fields filled, SADC complete |
| PLAN → IMPLEMENT | Scope output (Standard/Complex) |
| IMPLEMENT → VERIFY | Self-review pass, all IMPL steps done |
| VERIFY → DELIVER | All verification items PASS |

Any deviation from the Scope must appear in the delivery report's Scope Drift field.

## Deliverys

Two structured outputs bookend implementation: **Scope** (end of PLAN, before IMPLEMENT) and **Delivery** (end of DELIVER). The commitment says what will be built. The report says what was actually built and whether it matches.

### Scope (output at end of PLAN)

Used by Standard and Complex-tier tasks. Simple tasks scope internally (no formal output). This is the implementation contract — the delivery report will be measured against it.

```
☄️ COMMIT [Standard]
├─ Approach       : <primary approach, 1-2 sentences>
├─ Alternatives   : <2+ alternatives considered, 1 sentence each>
├─ Fallback       : <alternative if primary fails, 1 sentence>
├─ Pre-Deploy     : <local verification step before target deployment, or N/A>
├─ Scope IN       : <what's included>
├─ Scope OUT      : <what's explicitly excluded>
├─ IMPL Steps     : X (IMPL-001 to IMPL-XXX)
└─ Risk           : LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
```

### Summary (Simple)

```
☄️ REPORT [Simple]
SPECIFY→DELIVER : PASS | Evidence: <one-line result> | Defects: 0 | Drift: NONE
```

### Delivery (Standard / Complex)

```
☄️ REPORT [Standard]
├─ Continuation : NEW / YES
├─ IMPLEMENT     : PASS
│  ├─ Steps      : 4/4
│  ├─ Deviations : 0
│  └─ Quality    : lint PASS, tsc PASS
├─ VERIFY        : PASS
│  ├─ Checks     : 3/3
│  └─ Edge Cases : 2/2
├─ Pivot         : NONE
├─ Scope Drift   : NONE
└─ Outcome       : PASS

Evidence: [concrete results]
Defects found and fixed: 0
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Continuation | Whether this task continued from previous work |
| Steps | IMPL steps completed vs planned (e.g. 4/4) |
| Deviations | Times implementation diverged from plan (0 = clean) |
| Quality | Automated checks during implementation |
| Pivot | NONE, or details of approach change (trigger, from, to) |
| Scope Drift | NONE, or what changed from Scope |

If Pivot is not NONE, expand it:

```
├─ Pivot         : YES
│  ├─ From      : <original approach>
│  ├─ Trigger   : <what made us pivot>
│  ├─ To        : <new approach>
│  └─ Re-planned : X steps (IMPL-001 to IMPL-XXX)
```

If 3+ back-to-back pivots occurred, also include:
```
├─ Pivot Backlog : YES (3 pivots)
│  ├─ Meta-Pattern : <Documentation lies / Toolchain drift / Symptom cascade / Environment mismatch / Wrong abstraction level>
│  ├─ Meta-Review  : <what was re-examined in SPECIFY>
│  └─ Resolution   : <how the meta-pattern was addressed>
```

Pivot is not a failure marker — it's evidence of professional adaptation. An agent that pivots cleanly is more reliable than one that stubbornly forces a broken approach. But 3+ pivots on different errors signals a deeper issue — see Pivot Backlog Meta-Review in `procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md`.

### Minimal (non-coding: questions, explanations, recommendations)

```
☄️ PASS | Evidence: <one-line result>
```

All phases ran internally — SPECIFY, PLAN, and VERIFY produced no formal output. Only IMPLEMENT generated visible work. Single-line format.

Self-graded. The evidence requirement makes fabrication harder but cannot guarantee independence.

## Completion Signal

For interactive web development tasks (Next.js, UI components, dashboards), implementation is delegated to fullstack-dev — the DELIVER phase calls the platform's `Complete(project_type="web_dev", summary="...")` tool to finalize. For non-web coding tasks, DELIVER presents output file paths. **In all cases, DELIVER must append a Snapshot to `worklog.md`** — see Worklog Continuity Protocol in Session Continuity above.
