## Authentication

```bash
curl -H "X-SentiSense-API-Key: $SENTISENSE_API_KEY" \
  "https://app.sentisense.ai/api/v1/stocks/price?ticker=AAPL"
```

All endpoints require an API key. Free tier (1,000 req/month, 30 req/min) covers everyday use. PRO ($15/mo) removes the monthly request cap (unlimited, 300/min) and unlocks full preview-gated history.

| Tier | Quota | Rate |
|------|-------|------|
| Free | 1,000 req/month | 30 req/min |
| PRO | Unlimited | 300 req/min |

Anonymous calls return `401 api_key_required`.

## Capability Menu

Each capability is a natural-language command the user can give the agent. The agent's job is to recognize the intent, run the API calls in order, and synthesize the result. Specific endpoint reference at the bottom of this file.

---

### Capability 1: "Brief me on $TICKER"

A 5-line composite read on a stock that goes far beyond the quote.

**Synthesis pattern:**
1. `GET /api/v1/stocks/price?ticker={T}` to anchor with current price + day change
2. `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{T}/metric/sentiment` for the sentiment trend (server default window is the last 7 days)
3. `GET /api/v1/insider/trades/{T}?lookbackDays=90` for recent insider activity
4. `GET /api/v1/analyst/{T}/consensus` for the analyst price target band
5. `GET /api/v1/insights/stock/{T}` for AI insights (ranked by importance: relevance, confidence, and recency; take the first item for the headline)

**Synthesize as:** "AAPL $190.20 (+1.2%). Sentiment +0.34 and rising (+0.06 over 7d). 3 insider buys in 90d, no sells. Analyst target band $180-$250 (mean $210, 33 analysts, Buy). Latest insight: 'Margin guide raised, services revenue beating consensus.'"

The user gets a dense, terminal-grade read in five lines.

---

### Capability 2: "What's the smart money doing this week?"

Cross-reference insider cluster buys + congressional STOCK Act trades + analyst upgrades. Surface tickers where all three converge.

**Synthesis pattern:**
1. `GET /api/v1/insider/cluster-buys?lookbackDays=7` for tickers where multiple insiders bought
2. `GET /api/v1/politicians/activity?lookbackDays=7` for recent congressional purchases (filter to PURCHASE)
3. `GET /api/v1/analyst/activity?lookbackDays=7` for market-wide analyst actions (filter client-side to `actionType=="UPGRADE"`; the API has no server-side `types=` filter)

**Synthesize as:** intersect the three ticker lists. Report tickers in 2+ of the three buckets, with a one-liner on each: "NVDA: 4 insiders bought ($2.1M), 1 senator purchased $50k-$100k, 2 analyst upgrades."

This is a screen no free data source produces: convergence is the signal.

**Empty-window fallback:** the 7-day insider and congressional feeds frequently return empty arrays on quiet weeks (disclosure lag, `isPreview:false`, not an error). If `cluster-buys` or `politicians/activity` comes back empty, widen that call to `lookbackDays=30` and say so in the header so the screen is never silently blank.

---

### Capability 3: "Find divergence stocks"

Stocks where price action and sentiment disagree. A bullish gap (price down, sentiment up) often precedes a recovery; a bearish gap (price up, sentiment down) often precedes a fall.

**Synthesis pattern:**
1. `GET /api/v1/stocks/popular` to get the candidate list
2. For each: `GET /api/v1/stocks/chart?ticker={T}&timeframe=1M` (returns intraday bars, ~126 for a month, not daily closes; for a 7-day change filter to bars with `timestamp >= now-7d` and compare first vs last)
3. For each: `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{T}/metric/sentiment` (server default 7-day window; compute the trend over the returned series)
4. Rank by `|priceChange - sentimentChange|`; report top 5 each direction

**Synthesize as:** "Bullish divergence (price down, sentiment up): TSLA -8% / sentiment +12%. Bearish divergence (price up, sentiment down): COIN +14% / sentiment -9%."

---

### Capability 4: "Pre-earnings sentiment check on $TICKER"

Before an earnings report, agents and users want to know: is the smart-money / sentiment positioning bullish or bearish?

**Synthesis pattern:**
1. `GET /api/v1/stocks/{T}/profile` to confirm the ticker exists and pull sector/industry context (the API does not currently expose a next-earnings-date field; if the user supplies the earnings date, treat it as ground truth)
2. `GET /api/v2/metrics/entity/{T}/metric/sentiment?startTime={now-30d in epoch ms}&endTime={now in epoch ms}` for the 30-day trend
3. `GET /api/v1/insider/trades/{T}?lookbackDays=60` for 60-day insider activity
4. `GET /api/v1/analyst/{T}/estimates` for the consensus EPS band (returns `estimateLow / estimateMean / estimateHigh / numberOfAnalysts / periodLabel / periodType` plus a `surprises[]` history; no revenue figure and no revision history)
5. `GET /api/v1/analyst/{T}/actions?lookbackDays=30` for recent analyst rating changes

**Synthesize as:** "AAPL ER in 5d. Sentiment +0.22 over 30d, trending up (bullish). Insiders: 2 sells, 0 buys ($1.2M, neutral-to-bearish). EPS consensus $1.52 (range $1.48-$1.55, 28 analysts); beat in 3 of the last 4 quarters. 3 upgrades in 30d. Setup: mixed-bullish."

---

### Capability 5: "Sector rotation today"

Which sectors are in greed, which in fear, and what stocks are driving each.

**Synthesis pattern:**
1. `GET /api/v2/market-mood` for composite market mood + sector breakdowns. `sectors` is a string-keyed dict (not an array) with overlapping GICS labels (`Technology` and `Information Technology`, `Healthcare` and `Health Care`, etc.); iterate the dict values and dedupe these overlaps before ranking top and bottom
2. For each sector with `weeklyChange > +5` or `< -5`: `GET /api/v1/insights/market` (no params), then client-side filter the returned `data[]` to insights whose `insightText` mentions tickers known to belong to that sector (cross-reference with `GET /api/v1/stocks/descriptions?tickers=A,B,C` if you need the sector mapping). The endpoint itself has no server-side sector filter.
3. Report top 2 movers (positive) and bottom 2 (negative)

**Synthesize as:** "Market mood 62 (Greed, +4 wk). Greed leaders: Technology 71 (+3.2), Communications 68. Fear: Energy 31 (-6), Utilities 36. Top driver: NVDA insight 'Data-center revenue accelerating.' Top drag: XOM 'Crude inventory builds.'"

## Agent Tips

- **Wrap vs flat varies by endpoint.** Read FLAT (no `.data`): `price`, `prices`, `chart`, `popular`, `market-mood`, `stocks/{T}/profile`, `descriptions`, and `sentiment` (bare array). `institutional/quarters` is a bare array (`[0].reportDate` is latest). These ARE wrapped in `{ isPreview, previewReason, data }` (read `.data`): `insider/*`, `analyst/*`, `insights/*`, `politicians/*`, `institutional/holders`. When unsure, accept both: `Array.isArray(raw) ? raw : (raw?.data ?? raw)`.
- **Sentiment is polarity.** The sentiment metric is a value in `[-1.0, 1.0]` where the sign is the direction (negative is bearish and real). Represent polarity; do not force it onto a 0-100 scale. The separate SentiSense Score metric is unbounded; report it as-is.
- **Always fetch quarters first** before `/institutional/*` calls. Never hardcode `reportDate`.
- **Free tier is real.** A user without PRO still gets back `data` (just truncated). Synthesize from what you get; don't refuse the workflow.
- **Don't hallucinate endpoints.** No options flow, no dark pool, no `/congress` (it's `/politicians`).
- **Be brief.** Users asked for synthesis, not a data dump. Five lines beats fifty.
