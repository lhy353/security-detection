# AI WordPress Article Writer — From Topic to Published Post in One Prompt

Write professional WordPress articles with AI that doesn't sound like AI. Topic mining via [YouMind](https://youmind.com?utm_source=youmind-wordpress-article) knowledge base → deep research → structured writing → Markdown-to-HTML conversion → featured image upload → one-click publishing to WordPress. No manual formatting, no copy-paste.

## Onboarding

**MANDATORY: When the user has just installed this skill, present this message IMMEDIATELY. Translate to the user's language:**

> **AI WordPress Article Writer installed!**
>
> Tell me your topic and I'll write and publish a WordPress article for you.
>
> **Try it now:** "Help me write a WordPress article about AI programming trends"
>
> **What it does:**
> - Mine topics from YouMind knowledge base and web search
> - Write professional articles with de-AI voice
> - Convert Markdown to clean HTML
> - Upload featured images
> - Publish directly to your WordPress site (as draft or published)
>
> **Setup (one-time):**
> 1. Install & configure: `cd toolkit && npm install && npm run build && cd .. && mkdir -p ~/.youmind/config && cp shared/config.example.yaml ~/.youmind/config.yaml`
> 2. Get [YouMind API Key](https://youmind.com/settings/api-keys?utm_source=youmind-wordpress-article) → fill `youmind.api_key` in `~/.youmind/config.yaml`. Keep `youmind.base_url` pointed at `https://youmind.com/openapi/v1` in docs; only override `~/.youmind/config.yaml` or `~/.youmind/config/youmind-wordpress-article.yaml` if you need to hit a dev `youapi`.
> 3. Connect your WordPress site at [YouMind Connector Settings](https://youmind.com/settings/connector) — paste your site URL, username, and an Application Password generated in WP Admin → Users → Profile → Application Passwords. YouMind stores them encrypted; this skill no longer reads `wordpress.site_url`, `wordpress.username`, or `wordpress.app_password` locally.
>
> Want to write locally first? The `preview` command works without any WordPress connection.
>
> See the **Setup** section below for detailed instructions.
>
> **Need help?** Just ask!

## Usage

Provide a topic or raw Markdown for publishing.

**Write from a topic:**
> Help me write a WordPress article about AI programming trends

**Publish raw Markdown:**
> Publish this Markdown file to WordPress as a draft

**List recent posts:**
> Show my recent WordPress posts

## Setup

> Prerequisites: Node.js >= 18

### Step 1 — Install Dependencies

```bash
cd toolkit && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

### Step 2 — Create Config File

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.youmind/config
cp shared/config.example.yaml ~/.youmind/config.yaml
```

> **Canonical credentials:** put your shared YouMind credentials in `~/.youmind/config.yaml` — filled ONCE and read by every YouMind skill. See [`shared/config.example.yaml`](shared/config.example.yaml) for the template and [`shared/YOUMIND_HOME.md`](shared/YOUMIND_HOME.md). Optional skill overrides live in `~/.youmind/config/youmind-wordpress-article.yaml`.

### Step 3 — Get YouMind API Key (Required)

YouMind API Key drives knowledge base search, web search, article archiving, and WordPress publishing through the `/wordpress/*` OpenAPI proxy.

1. Open [YouMind API Keys page](https://youmind.com/settings/api-keys?utm_source=youmind-wordpress-article)
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Copy the `sk-ym-xxxx` key
4. Fill into `~/.youmind/config.yaml` under `youmind.api_key`
5. Keep `youmind.base_url` as `https://youmind.com/openapi/v1` in examples and documentation. Local backend testing should only override `~/.youmind/config.yaml` or `~/.youmind/config/youmind-wordpress-article.yaml`.

### Step 4 — Connect WordPress in YouMind (one-time, in the YouMind UI)

This skill never holds your WordPress credentials. It no longer reads `wordpress.site_url`, `wordpress.username`, or `wordpress.app_password` from repo-local config files. The credentials live encrypted in YouMind and are attached automatically when the proxy talks to your site.

1. In your WordPress admin: **Users → Profile → Application Passwords**, add a new password named "YouMind" and copy the generated string (shown only once).
2. Open [YouMind Connector Settings](https://youmind.com/settings/connector?utm_source=youmind-wordpress-article).
3. Pick **WordPress**. Paste your site URL (e.g. `https://myblog.com`), username, and the Application Password.
4. Save. YouMind validates against `/wp-json/wp/v2/users/me` immediately — a green check means the link is healthy.

To rotate or revoke: revoke the password in WP Admin, then disconnect WordPress in YouMind and reconnect with a fresh one.

### Verify Setup

```bash
cd toolkit && node dist/cli.js validate
```

You should see `OK: Connected to WordPress site as <username>`.

## Dispatch Integration (Optional)

This skill is **self-contained and fully usable standalone.** The `youmind-article-dispatch` hub is an optional companion; it is NOT required for anything.

- **Primary mode — standalone:** Invoke directly ("Write a WordPress article about X"). Works with zero other YouMind skills installed.
- **Author voice lookup:** This skill reads `~/.youmind/author-profile.yaml` (shared home directory — see `shared/YOUMIND_HOME.md`) for cross-platform voice preferences. Works whether or not dispatch is installed.
- **Optional dispatch-mode invocation:** When dispatch invokes this skill with a content brief containing `resolved_author`, the skill uses those fields as extra context. WordPress's SEO discipline — focus keyphrase, meta description, internal links, E-E-A-T — stays native to this skill regardless of invocation path.
- **Capability manifest (opt-in):** `dispatch-capabilities.yaml` includes the Yoast/RankMath SEO requirements for dispatch routing. Deleting it reverts to defaults; it never breaks this skill.
- **Optional interop protocol:** [`shared/DISPATCH_CONTRACT.md`](shared/DISPATCH_CONTRACT.md) (v1.0).

## Content Modes

Before writing any content, read `references/platform-dna.md` to internalize WordPress's real publishing surfaces: block editor, excerpt, featured image, categories/tags, scheduling, revisions, REST post fields, and Yoast/RankMath-style SEO discipline.

### Intent routing

| User's input | Operation | Playbook to load |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Idea, topic, or thesis only | Generate | `references/content-generation-playbook.md` |
| Existing article from blog/other platform | Cross-post | `references/content-adaptation-playbook.md` |
| Old WordPress post to refresh | Revive | `references/content-adaptation-playbook.md` (revive mode, SEO freshness) |
| Long piece → supporting posts | Condense/split | `references/content-adaptation-playbook.md` (condense mode) |
| Article in another language | Translate | `references/content-adaptation-playbook.md` (translate mode) |
| Same-language article needing SEO + site-voice adaptation | Localize | `references/content-adaptation-playbook.md` (localize mode) |
| Section from a pillar article → supporting post | Excerpt | `references/content-adaptation-playbook.md` (excerpt mode) |

### Quality gates (before publish)

1. **SEO critique**: Pass the Yoast/RankMath rubric in the playbook's Step 6
2. **Conformance report**: Generate and present to user (Step 7/8)
3. **User approval**: Do not auto-publish without confirmation

### Result Links Rule

After any draft or publish action, always end with `Result links`.

- Prefer the direct WordPress post URL.
- Include the best WordPress admin/posts URL when available for editing and result review.
- If no exact results page exists, return the best platform entry URL instead.
- Never leave the user with only a post ID or slug.

## Pipeline Overview

Read `references/pipeline.md` for full execution details.

| Step | Action | Key reference |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Load config, validate `youmind.api_key`, and confirm WordPress is connected in YouMind | — |
| 2 | Mine YouMind knowledge base for source material | `references/api-reference.md` |
| 3 | Research topic via web search | — |
| 4 | Adapt content structure for WordPress | `references/content-adaptation.md` |
| 5 | Write article in Markdown | — |
| 6 | Convert to HTML and publish through YouMind `/wordpress/*` OpenAPI | `pipeline.md` |
| 7 | Report results: title, URL, post ID, status, result links | — |

## Resilience: Never Stop on a Single-Step Failure

Every step has a fallback. If a step AND its fallback both fail, skip that step and note it in the final output.

| Step | Fallback |
|------|----------|
| 2 Knowledge mining | Skip, empty knowledge_context |
| 3 Web research | Ask user for manual input |
| 6 Publishing | Generate local HTML preview |

## Skill Directory

| Path | Purpose | When to read |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `references/pipeline.md` | Full step-by-step execution | When running the writing pipeline |
| `references/platform-dna.md` | WordPress audience, SEO rubric, format constraints | Before any content work |
| `references/content-generation-playbook.md` | Idea → WordPress-native draft workflow | When generating new content |
| `references/content-adaptation-playbook.md` | Existing article → WordPress-native workflow | When adapting/cross-posting content |
| `references/content-adaptation.md` | WordPress-specific writing rules (legacy) | Supplementary reference |
| `references/api-reference.md` | YouMind /wordpress/* OpenAPI contract | When calling the proxy from the toolkit |
| `~/.youmind/config.yaml` | Shared API credentials (YouMind only) | Step 1 (first-run check) |
| `output/` | **Local article Markdown drafts (git-ignored)** | When writing the article |
| `toolkit/dist/*.js` | Executable scripts | Various steps |

## Draft Location Rule

**Canonical:** write local article Markdown files to `~/.youmind/articles/wordpress/<slug>.md`. This shared home directory is available to all YouMind skills — see [`shared/YOUMIND_HOME.md`](shared/YOUMIND_HOME.md).

**Legacy fallback** (if `~/.youmind/` is not writable): `skills/youmind-wordpress-article/output/<slug>.md`.

- Correct: `~/.youmind/articles/wordpress/my-article.md`
- Correct (legacy): `skills/youmind-wordpress-article/output/my-article.md`
- Wrong: skill root directly, `references/`, `toolkit/`, or an ad-hoc `drafts/` directory

Both locations are git-ignored. Create directories on demand (`mkdir -p ~/.youmind/articles/wordpress`). Kebab-case filenames (`my-article.md`), descriptive slugs over timestamps.
