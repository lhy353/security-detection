# YouMind CLI Skill

Interact with the YouMind API to manage boards, crafts, notes, picks, and other content through the `youmind` CLI.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @youmind-ai/cli
```

To verify installation: `youmind` (should print usage info).

If the command is not found, install it first before proceeding.

## Authentication

If you do not have a YouMind API key yet, generate one at:

https://youmind.com/settings/api-keys

Then set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export YOUMIND_API_KEY=sk-ym-xxx
```

Or pass per-command with `--api-key sk-ym-xxx`.

## Commands

Three commands following a discover → inspect → execute workflow:

### 1. Search — Discover Available APIs

```bash
youmind search [query]
```

- Without query: list all available API endpoints
- With query: filter APIs by name or description (e.g., `search board`, `search craft`)
- Output: JSON array of `{ name, summary }` objects

### 2. Info — Inspect API Schema

```bash
youmind info <name>
```

- Returns the full schema including request body and response schema
- All `$ref` references are resolved inline
- Use this to understand required parameters before calling an API

### 3. Call — Execute an API

```bash
youmind call <name> [params]
```

Requires authentication. Three ways to pass parameters:

```bash
# Key-value pairs
youmind call createBoard --name "My Board"

# JSON string
youmind call createBoard '{"name":"My Board"}'

# Stdin pipe
echo '{"name":"My Board"}' | youmind call createBoard
```

## Workflow

To accomplish a task with the YouMind API:

1. **Search** for relevant APIs: `youmind search <keyword>`
2. **Inspect** the API schema: `youmind info <apiName>`
3. **Call** the API with correct parameters: `youmind call <apiName> [params]`

### Example: Create a board and add a note

```bash
# Find board-related APIs
youmind search board

# Check createBoard schema
youmind info createBoard

# Create the board
youmind call createBoard --name "Research Notes"

# Find note APIs and create a note
youmind search note
youmind info createNote
youmind call createNote '{"title":"First Note","boardId":"..."}'
```

## Global Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--api-key <key>` | API key (overrides `YOUMIND_API_KEY` env var) |
| `--endpoint <url>` | API endpoint (default: `https://youmind.com`) |
