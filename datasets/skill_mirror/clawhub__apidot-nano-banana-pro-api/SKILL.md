# APIDot Nano Banana Pro API

Use APIDot as a Nano Banana Pro-focused API surface for prompt-based image generation, image editing, image-to-image workflows, polling, and webhook delivery.

This skill is for routing Nano Banana Pro questions to the right APIDot docs, examples, reference notes, and async integration pattern. It is documentation-only: it includes no scripts, makes no network requests, and does not store credentials.

This release contains `SKILL.md` plus non-executable notes in `references/api.md`. It includes no executable files, install-time automation, review automation helpers, shell automation, bundled API clients, automatic network calls, or stored credentials.

## When To Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- Build a Nano Banana Pro API integration with APIDot.
- Generate images from prompts, source images, design prompts, product assets, or marketing concepts.
- Edit or transform images with reference-guided workflows.
- Use Nano Banana Pro through APIDot for image generation or image editing.
- Implement APIDot async image jobs with task submission, task status polling, or webhook callbacks.
- Find APIDot Nano Banana Pro docs, model pages, or runnable examples.

## Security Rules

- Treat `APIDOT_API_KEY` as a secret.
- Keep APIDot API keys in server-side environment variables or a backend secret manager.
- Never place an API key in browser code, frontend bundles, public repos, logs, screenshots, or chat output.
- Do not make live API calls unless the user explicitly asks and provides a safe server-side environment.
- Do not invent API facts, commercial terms, model availability, reliability claims, or competitor comparisons.
- Use current APIDot docs and model pages for model-specific request fields and current product details.

## Nano Banana Pro Workflow

APIDot Nano Banana Pro generation usually follows an async task pattern:

1. Choose the Nano Banana Pro request mode from the current APIDot docs.
2. Submit the generation or edit request through the documented APIDot async generation flow.
3. Save the returned `data.task_id` immediately.
4. Poll task status with the documented task status API for local tests.
5. Use `callback_url` webhook delivery for production queues or user workflows that may outlive the current page.
6. Store final image URLs only after the task reaches a terminal success state.

Do not guess model-specific payload fields. If the user needs copyable request examples, point them to the current APIDot docs or the matching APIDot GitHub example.

## Model Routing

Start from the user's Nano Banana Pro task, then open the matching APIDot source:

| User Goal | Start Here |
| --- | --- |
| Browse APIDot Nano Banana Pro model page | https://apidot.ai/models/nano-banana-pro |
| Read APIDot API docs | https://apidot.ai/docs |
| Learn APIDot quickstart flow | https://apidot.ai/docs/quickstart |
| Implement webhooks | https://apidot.ai/docs/webhooks |
| Build with Nano Banana Pro | https://apidot.ai/docs/nano-banana-pro |
| Use runnable Nano Banana Pro examples | https://github.com/APIDotAI/nano-banana-pro-api |
| Use general APIDot examples | https://github.com/APIDotAI/apidot-examples |

For Nano Banana Pro request modes, prefer the live APIDot model page and docs page. Do not copy request fields from another image model family unless the APIDot docs show the same field.

Use `references/api.md` for a local, non-executable summary of Nano Banana Pro model routing, request planning, and async workflow notes.

## Integration Guidance

- Use `apidot-image-generation-api` when the user needs broad image generation guidance across several model families.
- Use this skill when the user is specifically building with Nano Banana Pro through APIDot.
- Ask which image task the user needs before choosing a model-specific example: prompt-based image generation, image editing, image-to-image, product visual, marketing creative, or reference-guided generation.
- Persist `task_id`, selected model, user ID, source media references, request status, and final image URLs together.
- Validate source image URLs before submitting workflows that depend on reference images.
- Treat webhook handlers as idempotent. Duplicate callback deliveries should not create duplicate visible results.
- Retry transient network failures with backoff. Do not retry invalid payloads unchanged.
- Avoid logging API keys, private prompts, private image URLs, generated image URLs, or callback URLs.
