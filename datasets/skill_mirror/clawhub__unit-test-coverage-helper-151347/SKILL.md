  Help users with Validated demand: Teams need repeatable help adding useful unit tests and raising test coverage for existing codebases. This requirement is supported by 11 separate online signals across 2 source families, so it represents broader demand rather than a single isolated request.. Use when a user asks for software-and-data, unit tests, test coverage, testing, regression, or needs a practical workflow, artifact, checklist, analysis, or implementation support for this requirement.

# Unit Test Coverage Helper

## Requirement

Use this skill to help software maintainers, QA engineers, open-source contributors, and product teams who need confidence that changes do not break existing behavior with:

> Validated demand: Teams need repeatable help adding useful unit tests and raising test coverage for existing codebases. This requirement is supported by 11 separate online signals across 2 source families, so it represents broader demand rather than a single isolated request.

Demand score: 90/100 (`70/70` demand, `30/30` local feasibility).
Evidence: 11 signals across 2 source families.

Read `references/requirement-plan.md` when source evidence, planning details, or review criteria are needed.

## Workflow

1. Restate the user's outcome, constraints, available inputs, and success criteria.
2. Inspect technical constraints, propose implementation steps, and include test or verification commands when code or data is involved.
3. Ask only for missing information that materially changes the output; otherwise make reasonable assumptions and continue.
4. Keep the implementation local-hardware friendly: prefer scripts, templates, checklists, and small-model or CPU-safe workflows over cloud-only or large-training approaches.
5. Produce the requested artifact, workflow, checklist, analysis, code change, or decision support.
6. Validate the output against the success criteria and list any remaining risks or follow-up work.

## Expected Outputs

- A tailored answer or artifact for the user's immediate situation.
- A reusable checklist or workflow when the task is repeatable.
- A verification note showing how the result was checked.

## Validation

- The output directly addresses the discovered requirement.
- The user can act on the result without reading the original source post.
- Assumptions, limits, and required inputs are visible.
- The final response includes a short usage or next-step note when helpful.
